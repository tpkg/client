# tpkg - Application Packaging and Deployment

tpkg is a tool for packaging and deploying applications. It is designed
to work alongside your operating system's packaging tool.

The packaging features of tpkg work in a similar fashion as many OS
packaging tools like rpm, dpkg, SysV, etc, but with some additional
features.  tpkg is designed to be cross-platform so that you can use the
same tool across all the operating systems in your environment.

The deployment features in tpkg are designed to scale to deployments
across hundreds or thousands of systems.
